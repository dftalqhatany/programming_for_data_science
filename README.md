# AI Data Quality Analyst 📊

AI Data Quality Analyst is an intelligent tool that analyzes datasets and evaluates their quality before using them in reporting, analysis, or machine learning tasks.

The application automatically scans the dataset, detects common data issues, and provides a **readiness score (0–100)** along with **clear recommendations and visual insights** to help improve the data before using it.

---

# Overview

Data often appears clean at first glance but may contain hidden problems such as:

- Missing values
- Duplicate records
- Inconsistent data types
- Outliers
- Poor column structure

These issues can cause incorrect results in reports, analytics, or machine learning models.

This project helps solve that problem by providing an **automated data quality assessment system** that evaluates datasets and generates useful insights.

---

# Key Features

### 1. Data Quality Analysis
The system automatically analyzes datasets and detects:

- Missing values
- Duplicate rows
- Outliers
- Data type inconsistencies
- Dataset structure issues

---

### 2. Readiness Scoring System
The application calculates a **Data Readiness Score (0–100)** that indicates how suitable the dataset is for the selected task.

Tasks include:

- **Reporting**
- **Data Analysis**
- **Machine Learning**

Each task has different quality requirements.

---

### 3. Visual Data Insights
The system generates visual charts to help users quickly understand dataset issues:

- Missing values chart
- Data types distribution
- Outlier visualization

---

### 4. AI-Powered Analysis
The project integrates AI to generate:

- Dataset summaries
- Quality evaluation explanations
- Practical improvement suggestions

This helps users understand **why the dataset received its score**.

---

### 5. Interactive Dashboard
The application includes a simple dashboard that shows:

- Dataset overview
- Quality metrics
- Charts and statistics
- AI recommendations

---

### 6. PDF Report Generation
Users can export a **professional PDF report** containing:

- Dataset summary
- Quality score
- Key findings
- Visual charts
- AI recommendations
